# Container UCS Base

This project does build a few container images which are prepared so that UCS
packages can be installed.

It started based from a fragment which we saw being repeated over and over
across many of our `Dockerfile` files.


## Status - Beta

We try to apply the DRY (Don't repeat yourself) principle. It is tagged as
"Beta" since we have only little experience so far with the approach.
